# geoGraffiti- Front End

‘geoGraffiti’ is a creative web application targeted at mobile users. The app allows users to draw a picture using the touch screen of their phone and save it to a specific location using geo-tagging based on the GPS co-ordinates from their phone. Other users are then able to view the drawing if they are sufficiently close enough to where the image has been geo-tagged. The front end has been built using React and Google Maps API and the back end has been built using Python, Flask, SQLite and Firebase.

The web application is hosted here: https://geograffiti.netlify.com/

Note the application has been built with Chrome on Android and Safari on iOS. Performance on other browsers has not been tested.

## To run this project locally:

1. Click on the repo's "Clone or Download" button link and copy the URL (https://github.com/NaomiM24/geograffiti.git)
2. Navigate to where you'd like the application to be copied in your command line and write:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NaomiM24/geograffiti.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the newly-created folder in your command line interface and type `npm install` to install all dependencies.

4. To run, simply type the comment `npm start`.

## How does the app work?

### User Log in:

User log in is handled by Firebase SDK Authentication. The Firebase Authentication SDK provides methods to create and manage users that use their email addresses and passwords to sign in. The IDs generated by Firebase are then used for controlling content of the app.

### Canvas Drawing:

The canvas drawing element of the app has been built using the help of the `react-canvas-draw` library. This library provides the math required to create the drawings. It takes a radius of brush and the {x,y} coordinates of a mouse/pointer. With this data its able to calculate and freely draw smooth lines and curves with just a pointer or finger.

Data from the drawing is stored as an object containing a series strings of the {x,y} coordiantes. It is this object data which enables the easy transmision and storage of the user drawings as well as the animation of the drawing being rendered in front of the user.

### Map and geo-location:

The map rendering has been handled using GoogleMaps API. For the map to work, the browser asks permission to access the users phone location. Once granted the user icon and map is centred on the value provided by the internal phone gps. The map view then displays graffiti can icons (indicating nearby drawings) which it gets from the back-end database of geo-tagged drawings.

### Back end & RESTful API:

A database which uses SQLite has already been set up (see: https://github.com/jcraggs/BE-Geograffiti). This database contains all the graffiti and users data. The database is accesible via an API and is hosted on PythonAnywhere (see: https://geograffiti.pythonanywhere.com/api).
